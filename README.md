A BakkesMod plugin to help with practicing hoops kickoffs.

# Usage

Plugin adds two simple features when loading a local Hoops session:
1. In freeplay, all won't do kickoff motion until you move your car
2. Disables spawn location randomization and spawn can be controlled via GUI (F2 -> Plugins -> Hoops Kickoff Practice to open, or F6 -> togglemenu hoopskickoffpractice)

These features work with multiple players in any local session, including those hosted via Rocket Plugin.
To use with Rocket Plugin, select Hoops as the game mode in addition to selecting the Dunkhouse map.

# Known Bugs

* Plugin doesn't work on the first kickoff. Just reset the ball and it should work.
* Player spawn locations don't update when new players join/leave until you reset the ball.
